    "    \n",
    "Random variables are so important in random experiments that sometimes we essentially ignore the original sample space of the experiment and focus on the probability distribution of the random variable. For example, in Example 3-1, our analysis might focus exclusively on the integers {0, 1, . . . , 48} in the range of X."

    "\n",
    "The probability distribution of a random variable X is a description of the probabilities associated with the possible values of X. For a discrete random variable, the distribution is often speci ed by just a list of the possible values along with the probability of each. In some cases, it is convenient to express the probability in terms of a formula."
